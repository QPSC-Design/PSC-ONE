# PSC-ONE Hardware

This directory contains the RTL hardware design of **PSC-ONE**, a fully custom FPGA-based RISC-V SoC.

---

## Overview

PSC-ONE is an experimental full-stack SoC that integrates:

* A custom RISC-V CPU
* Cache and memory-management units
* SDRAM and boot memory
* Storage and multimedia interfaces
* Custom hardware accelerators
* A dedicated operating system, PSC-OS

The project is designed as a hardware/software co-design platform for CPU architecture, operating systems, memory systems, and application-specific accelerators.

The main target platform is currently the **Tang Nano 20K**, using the FPGA's internal SDRAM as system memory.

---

## Main Components

### PSC_RV32ISP CPU

**PSC_RV32ISP** is a custom 32-bit RISC-V processor designed from scratch for PSC-ONE.

The following diagram shows the internal architecture of the PSC_RV32ISP CPU and its connection to the PSC-ONE memory subsystem.

The CPU integrates instruction fetch and execution logic, general-purpose registers, CSR control, privilege-mode handling, Sv32 address translation, instruction and data caches, and interfaces to system memory and memory-mapped peripherals.

Current CPU features include:

* RV32I base integer instruction set
* Zicsr CSR instructions
* Zifencei instruction support
* Integer multiplication support
* Integer division and remainder support
* Machine, Supervisor, and User privilege modes
* Exception and interrupt handling
* ECALL and SRET support
* Sv32 virtual memory
* Instruction and data caches
* Load-use and register-dependency handling
* Optional pipelined execution
* Custom hardware-accelerator integration

The CPU is designed to execute PSC-OS and user applications directly on the FPGA.

---

### Memory Management Unit

PSC-ONE includes an Sv32-compatible virtual-memory system.

The memory-management architecture includes:

* Sv32 page-table translation
* SATP register support
* `SFENCE.VMA` support
* Machine, Supervisor, and User address spaces
* Memory protection through page permissions
* Separate kernel and user memory regions

The MMU allows PSC-OS to execute user programs in a protected virtual address space.

---

### Cache System

PSC-ONE includes separate instruction and data cache paths.

The cache architecture supports:

* Cached instruction fetches
* Cached data reads and writes
* Write-back operation
* Write-no-allocate behavior
* Cache bypass for memory-mapped peripherals
* Software-managed coherency with hardware accelerators

SynapEngine and other accelerators share the system memory with the CPU. Software performs the required cache synchronization before and after accelerator execution.

---

### SDRAM System

The current Tang Nano 20K implementation uses the FPGA's integrated SDRAM as the main system memory.

The memory subsystem provides storage for:

* PSC-OS kernel
* User programs
* Application data
* Matrix input and output data
* Audio samples
* SD-card transfer buffers

The CPU, caches, DMA-related logic, and hardware accelerators access the shared memory architecture.

---

### Boot System

PSC-ONE contains boot ROM logic used to initialize the system and load software from an SD card.

The boot process loads:

* PSC-OS kernel image
* User program image
* Required runtime data

The loaded software is copied into system memory before execution begins.

---

### SD Card Interface

PSC-ONE includes an SPI-mode SD-card controller.

Current SD-card support includes:

* SD-card initialization
* Single-sector read
* Single-sector write
* FAT32 filesystem access
* Kernel and user-program loading
* File access from PSC-OS
* Audio and application-data storage

SPI mode is used to keep the hardware implementation compact and reliable.

---

### SynapEngine

**SynapEngine** is the matrix-processing accelerator integrated into PSC-ONE.

The following diagram shows the internal architecture of SynapEngine.

SynapEngine implements a logical 4×4 Output-Stationary systolic array using virtualized PE contexts. PE state and dataflow control are separated from the arithmetic units, allowing the logical PE array to share a configurable number of external multipliers.

<img src="../docs/images/PSC_SynapEngine.jpg" width="800">

The current implementation provides:

* 4×4 logical int8 systolic array
* Output-Stationary dataflow
* 32-bit partial-sum accumulation
* Virtualized Processing Elements
* Hardware-multithreading-style PE execution
* Shared PE control logic
* External arithmetic units
* Configurable number of physical multipliers
* Support for matrices larger than 4×4 through tiled execution
* Direct integration with the CPU cache and memory system
* cocotb-based verification

Unlike a conventional systolic array, SynapEngine does not require a dedicated multiplier inside every PE.

The PE contexts maintain dataflow state and partial sums, while multiplication is performed by a configurable number of external shared multipliers.

Conceptually:

```text
Logical PE contexts
        │
        ▼
Arithmetic scheduler
        │
        ▼
Shared multiplier units
        │
        ▼
PE partial-sum accumulation
```

This architecture allows the number of physical multipliers to be selected independently of the logical 4×4 array size.

Because the arithmetic units are separated from PE control and state, future versions may support arithmetic operations other than integer multiplication.

Possible future extensions include:

* FP16 or BF16 arithmetic
* Alternative arithmetic operators
* 1×16 or 16×1 logical PE arrangements
* FIR filtering
* One-dimensional convolution
* Configurable PE interconnect topologies

These topology-reconfiguration features are architectural concepts and are not implemented in the current version.

### PFE QUBO Engine

PSC-ONE includes an experimental **PFE** accelerator for QUBO-related computation.

The PFE engine provides:

* Memory-mapped control
* QUBO coefficient input
* Binary-variable input
* Hardware energy calculation
* CPU-readable result and status registers

This engine is used to explore non-von-Neumann and optimization-oriented hardware architectures.

---

### I2S Audio Interface

PSC-ONE contains an I2S receive interface for digital microphone input.

The current audio path supports:

* Mono audio input
* 16 kHz sampling
* 24-bit I2S sample reception
* FIFO-based buffering
* PSC-OS audio capture
* SD-card storage of recorded samples

The audio interface is intended for future speech-recognition and signal-processing experiments.

---

### Display Interface

PSC-ONE supports an ILI9488-based LCD module.

The display interface is used for:

* System status output
* Application output
* Audio and AI demonstration interfaces
* Standalone operation without a host terminal

---

### UART Interface

The UART interface provides:

* Boot and debug output
* PSC-OS command-line access
* Test-result output
* Hardware and software diagnostics

UART is the primary development and debugging interface.

---

## Interconnect Architecture

PSC-ONE uses a unified memory-mapped address architecture.

The address space contains:

* Boot ROM
* SDRAM
* Cacheable system memory
* UART
* SD-card controller
* I2S interface
* Display controller
* SynapEngine
* PFE accelerator
* Other control and status registers

Memory accesses are routed according to the target address.

Normal memory is accessed through the cache and SDRAM paths, while peripheral regions bypass the cache and access the corresponding hardware modules directly.

---

## Hardware/Software Co-Design

PSC-ONE hardware is developed together with PSC-OS.

PSC-OS provides software interfaces for:

* Process execution
* Virtual memory
* SD-card and FAT32 access
* Audio capture
* Display output
* SynapEngine matrix multiplication
* PFE QUBO calculation
* Hardware diagnostics

This allows new hardware features to be tested through complete software workloads rather than isolated RTL simulations alone.

---

## Verification

PSC-ONE uses multiple levels of verification:

* RTL simulation
* cocotb testbenches
* CPU instruction tests
* Cache and memory-access tests
* Full SoC boot simulation
* SynapEngine matrix-result comparison
* SD-card read/write tests
* FPGA implementation tests

Hardware accelerator results are compared against software reference implementations.

---

## Current Status

The current PSC-ONE hardware supports:

* Custom RV32 CPU operation
* Machine, Supervisor, and User privilege modes
* Sv32 virtual memory
* Instruction and data caches
* Internal SDRAM access
* SD-card boot
* FAT32 read and write
